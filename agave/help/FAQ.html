            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions / Scenarios</h2>
            <p>
                This is a collection of topics that frequently come up while building brackets
                using BracketBuilder. We're always looking for more topics to add here, so please
                <a href="mailto:red@traynrex.com">let us know</a> about things you run into often and how you solve them.
            </p>
            <h3><a name="manuallySelect"><a name="InsertLocation">Manually selecting where a game gets inserted</a></a></h3>
            <p>
                Most of the time, BracketBuilder does a good job figuring out how to place a game
                on the bracket, including shifting other games around to make things fit. Sometimes, though,
                you just want a game to go in a specific place. There are a few things you can do.
            </p>
            <h4>Choose the day for the game</h4>
            <p>
                The most common selection for inserting a game is to just click somewhere in the column for the
                day you want the game to be placed on.
            </p>
            <p>
                Be careful, if you click in a cell that is close to where
                BracketBuilder might place the game, then it might get confused and think you are actually asking for
                a specific place. The best way to avoid this is to click at the top of the column you want to insert in.
            </p>
            <h4>Choose the starting cell for the game</h4>
            <p>
                If you only want to tell BracketBuilder where you would like a game to <i>start</i> (i.e. where
                the top of the game should be), then just click in the cell where you want the top team
                name to be.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you do this, BracketBuilder will try to insert the game at this location. Note that
                if there are game conflicts (overlapping games, etc), then BracketBuilder might still try
                to adjust your selection. The most common automatic adjustments:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Insert the game <i>above</i> your selection - BracketBuilder will do this if it thinkgs
                        that flipping the game top/bottom will make it fit better
                    </li>
                    <li>Insert the game two cells up or down from your selection</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Since BracketBuilder is trying to insert where you are asking it to, this sometimes means
                it gets confused when you have clicked in a column and you aren't asking for a specific place. If you
                are being told that you can't insert a game at the requested location and you aren't trying to
                ask for a specfic place, then just click in a cell at the top of the column you want to place the
                game in.
            </p>
            <h4>Choosing the exact range for the game</h4>
            <p>
                This is the most specific way to tell BracketBuilder where to put the game. When you do this, BracketBuilder
                will place the game at your selection even if it means breaking the bracket
            </p>
            <p>
                BracketBuilder will still make some adjustments even when you specific range:
                <ul>
                    <li>Move the game up or down 1 row to make it fit better</li>
                    <li>Grow or shrink the game by 1 row to make it fit</li>
                    <li>Rearrange the games on the grid in order to make it fit</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3><a name="gameDependencies">What are game dependencies?</a></h3>
            <p>
                Each game has two teams playing. With the exception of the first game for each team, each of these teams
                comes from a previous game -- either the winner or the loser of that game. BracketBuilder will
                connect the winner of a game with the next game that the winning team will play.
            </p>
            <p>
                The bracket is laid out with each column as a day of the week. (Actually, you can have more
                than one column for a day, but we'll cover that later). Each game will be in one of those columns
                in the bracket. This means that every game has to be placed in a column <i>after</i> all of the games
                that feed into it. These are called the <i>game dependencies</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, if Game 19 is played between the winner of game 15 (W15) and the winner of game 13 (W13),
                then Game 19 has to be in a column <i>after</i> both games 15 and 13. If you try to place a game in the
                same column as one of its dependencies, then BracketBuilder will tell you it can't insert the game, and it
                will suggest what column you have to put the game in.
            </p>
            <p>If you need to play two games on the same day, see the section on Creating Double-Headers.</p>
            <h3><a name="doubleHeaders">How do I create a double-header?</a></h3>
            <p>
                There is no way to place a game in the same column as one of its dependencies. There is nothing that says
                you can't have more than one column for any given day, though. In fact, we do this already when we extend
                the last day of the tournament to include the <i>champion</i> game (which isn't really a game, its just
                the fancy place we put the name of the tournament champion).
            </p>
            <p>
                Someday, maybe we'll make a bracket command to make a day take up more columns, but for now its a manual
                process. This is also a good step-by-step guide on how you can really tweak the schedule!
            </p>
            <h4>
                Scenario: Double header for the what-if game
            </h4>
            <zoomable>
                <floatRight style="width: 20vw">
                    <img src="Images/DH-Start.png" class="whiteBack" />
                </floatRight>
            </zoomable>
            <p>
                Let's imagine we have a 4 team bracket, and we want to play the what-if game on the same day
                as the championship game as a double-header.  We want the championship game at 3pm and the what-if
                will be at 6pm.
            </p>
            <p>
                To do this, we are going to merge two of the days together in the header so that a single day now has
                two columns. We also have to fix the day formulas. There are several steps:
            </p>
            <br clear="all" />
            <steps>
                <iconic>
                    <img src="Images/DH-TwoDays.png" class="whiteBackSmaller" />
                </iconic>
                <p>
                    First, determine which days you want to merge. You can merge as many days as you want, but this example
                    will only demonstrate two days.
                </p>
            </steps>
            <steps>
                <iconic>
                    <img src="Images/DH-SelectBothDays.png" class="whiteBackSmaller" />
                </iconic>
                <p>
                    Select the two cells for the day-of-week to merge. You have to merge the day-of-the week cells (Monday/Tuesday/Wednesday)
                    and the date cells (June 19, June 20, June 21) separately, so for the first step, only select the day-of-the-week cells.
                </p>
            </steps>
            <steps>
                <iconic>
                    <img src="Images/DH-MergeAndCenterRibbon.png" class="whiteBackSmaller" />
                </iconic>
                <p>
                    On the home tab, find <cmd>Merge and center</cmd> button on the alignment chunk -- it should be in the
                    depressed state, showing that the current selection is already merged. Click on <cmd>Merge and center</cmd> to unmerge
                    the cells.
                </p>
            </steps>
            <steps>
                <iconic>
                    <img src="Images/DH-AfterDayUnmerge.png" class="whiteBackSmaller" />
                </iconic>
                <p>
                    After the day-of-the-week cells are unmerged, you should still have the cells selected which will make it easier to
                    merge both days all together. If all the cells aren't selected, that's ok -- you just have to reselect them. Be sure
                    to select <em>all</em> of the cell between the lines (in this example, select M5:Q5)
                </p>
            </steps>
            <steps>
                <iconic>
                    <img src="Images/DH-ExcelError.png" class="whiteBackSmaller" />
                </iconic>
                <p>
                    Now we want to merge both days together. With the cells selected from the previous step, click the
                    <cmdMerge and center</cmd> button again.  When you do this, you will get an Excel warning about
                    merging contents, click OK. We will fix up the formulas in the next step.
                </p>
            </steps>
            <steps>
                <iconic>
                    <img src="Images/DH-AfterDayMerge.png" class="whiteBackSmaller" />
                </iconic>
                <p>The day-of-week cells are now merged together. We still have to deal with the date cells.</p>
            </steps>

            <steps>
                <iconic>
                    <img src="Images/DH-AfterAllMerge.png" class="whiteBackSmaller" />
                </iconic>
                <p>Repeat this same procedure for the date cells in Row 6 that you want to merge together.</p>
            </steps>
            <steps>
                <iconic>
                    <img src="Images/DH-BrokenDay.png" class="whiteBackSmaller" />
                </iconic>
                <p>
                    With the day-of-week and the date cells merged together, we have now created multiple columns for
                    a single day. Unfortunately, that warning that Excel gave about merging cells actually mattered.
                    When we merged the cells, we broke the date formulas for the later days.
                    To fix this, we have to fixup the formula for the broken day.<br /><br />Click on the cell with the broken date (S6 in this example)
                </p>
            </steps>

            <h3><a name="broken">Why is my bracket broken?</a></h3>
            <p>
                When you get an error about the bracket being broken, there's not a lot you can do to fix it. This error
                means that something internal on the workbook has become broken or inconsistent. It might be that a part
                of a game didn't get inserted, or a game was partially removed. It also could be that a game ended up getting
                inserted on top of another game.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are really daring, you can try to erase the parts of the bracket that are confusing things. If you want to
                do this, make sure to clear not just the contents of the cells, but also the names of the cells (remember that
                BracketBuilder uses named cells in order to keep track of where games are on the bracket). Selecting cells
                and using the <a href="./Commands.html#RemoveGame">button</a> might help you do this.
            </p>
            <p>
                When all else fails, sometimes its just easier to start over with a new bracket. When you do this, make sure you
                insert games in the places you want them to be in (since you now know where you want them).
            </p>
            <h3><a name="insertLocation">Why is BracketBuilder complaining about the insert location?</a></h3>
            <p>
                When you click the <cmd>Insert Game</cmd> button, <prodRef>BracketBuilder</prodRef> will try to figure
                out where to place the game. One thing it can't figure out on its own is what day to place the game on. (Actually,
                for the very first game of the tournament, it will automatically put the game on the first day).
            </p>
            <p>
                This means that you need to tell <prodRef>BracketBuilder</prodRef> which day to use. To do this, you have to click on a cell
                in the column for the day you want the game to be on. If you click at the top of the column, then <prodRef>BracketBuilder</prodRef>
                will automatically pick what it thinks is the best spot for the game. If you click somewhere else in the column, then
                it will try to place the game as close to that position as possible
            </p>
            <zoomable>

                </floatRight>
            </zoomable>
            <p>
                If you have selected more than once cell, then <prodRef>BracketBuilder</prodRef> will treat this as exactly the location
                you want to insert in (plus or minus one row). If this selection isn't within the grid, then you will get an error message.
            </p>
            <p>
                The bracket is laid out on a <a href="SheetEditing.html#structure">repeating grid of rows/columns</a> which makes it
                possible to format the connecting lines and create the bracket you see. The repeating columns are pretty easy to see
                since each set of 3 columns make up a day in the tournament. To find the repeating row pattern, look for the really short
                rows on the sheet -- by default, these start with Row 11.
            </p>
            <p>
                To specify an exact game location on the bracket, you have to select a cell that is on or after the first cell in the
                repeating grid pattern. If you don't, you will get an error. The error should tell you which cell is the first in the grid.
            </p>
            <h3><a name="insertFailed">Why did I get an insertion failure when I tried to add a game?</a></h3>
            <p>
                When you add a game to the bracket, lots of things can go wrong. The <em>insert failed</em> error is sort of a
                catch all for all of these failures. Hopefully the error message gives you some more details about what you can do
                to fix the problem.
            </p>
            <h4>Overlapping games</h4>
            <p>
                For example, a game might fail because <prodRef>BracketBuilder</prodRef> can't insert the game without the new game
                overlapping an existing game already on the bracket. In many cases, it can adjust the bracket to make things fit, but
                it only knows so many tricks.
            </p>
            <p>
                The error message should tell you where on the grid the overlapping game or line is. To fix it, you will probably have
                to remove games (or use <cmd>Undo</cmd>) to get back to a poing when you can start adding games back in a different
                order, or at different places (by <a href="./FAQ.html#manuallySelect">manually selecting</a> the game location).
            </p>
            <p>
                Remember, if the bracket was automatically reorganized earlier, it will probably be best to use <cmd>Undo</cmd> since
                that will also undo the bracket adjustments
            </p>
            <h4>Overlapping game results</h4>

            One of the things that <prodRef>BracketBuilder</prodRef> checks when inserting a game is whether or not an existing
            game on the bracket is going to have a line coming out of it to another game. </p>
        <p>For example, if you have a game between the two games that need to play each other, when you try to place that next game,
            the insert will fail because the result of that game in the middle would run into the game you are about to place. To fix this,
            you have to either remove the game in the middle, or rearrange the grid so the two games that feed into the next game are next to
            each other.  NOTE: in reality, <prodRef>BracketBuilder</prodRef> knows how to fix this particular example and would automatically
            rearrange the grid for you. But in a bigger bracket, with more games already played, it probably won't be able to fix it
            automatically.

                I've tried to make <prodRef>BracketBuilder</prodRef> as robust as possible, but sometimes unexpected things happen. Currently, I do
                <em>not</em> send error reports. This means that you might see a fatal error/exception show up with an ask for you
                to send the details information to us to try to fix. This is <superEm>absolutely voluntary</superEm>, but much appreciated.
            </p>
