                        This is a collection of topics that frequently come up while building brackets
                        using BracketBuilder. We're always looking for more topics to add here, so please

                                Most of the time, BracketBuilder does a good job figuring out how to place a game
                                on the bracket, including shifting other games around to make things fit. Sometimes, though,
                                you just want a game to go in a specific place. There are a few things you can do.
                            </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The most common selection for inserting a game is to just click somewhere in the column for the
                                        day you want the game to be placed on.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Be careful, if you click in a cell that is close to where
                                        BracketBuilder might place the game, then it might get confused and think you are actually asking for
                                        a specific place. The best way to avoid this is to click at the top of the column you want to insert in.
                                    </p>
                                </content>

                                <content>
                                    <p>
                                        If you only want to tell BracketBuilder where you would like a game to <i>start</i> (i.e. where
                                        the top of the game should be), then just click in the cell where you want the top team
                                        name to be.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        When you do this, BracketBuilder will try to insert the game at this location. Note that
                                        if there are game conflicts (overlapping games, etc), then BracketBuilder might still try
                                        to adjust your selection. The most common automatic adjustments:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>
                                                Insert the game <i>above</i> your selection - BracketBuilder will do this if it thinkgs
                                                that flipping the game top/bottom will make it fit better
                                            </li>
                                            <li>Insert the game two cells up or down from your selection</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Since BracketBuilder is trying to insert where you are asking it to, this sometimes means
                                        it gets confused when you have clicked in a column and you aren't asking for a specific place. If you
                                        are being told that you can't insert a game at the requested location and you aren't trying to
                                        ask for a specfic place, then just click in a cell at the top of the column you want to place the
                                        game in.
                                    </p>

                                        This is the most specific way to tell BracketBuilder where to put the game. When you do this, BracketBuilder
                                        will place the game at your selection even if it means breaking the bracket
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        BracketBuilder will still make some adjustments even when you specific range:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Move the game up or down 1 row to make it fit better</li>
                                            <li>Grow or shrink the game by 1 row to make it fit</li>
                                            <li>Rearrange the games on the grid in order to make it fit</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </p>

                                <prodRef>BracketBuilder</prodRef> tries to make adding games as easy as possible, but that can be pretty hard sometimes.
                                It tries to
                                <em>do what you want</em> when you insert a game, but sometimes you might want it to
                                <skimmable>
                                    do something
                                    automatically,
                                </skimmable> and sometimes you want it do just
                                <skimmable>do exactly what you told it</skimmable> to do.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you only have a single cell selected when you insert a game, <prodRef>BracketBuilder</prodRef> will try to
                                insert the game in the best possible location based on a bunch of rules.

                                A lot of the rules around where games go are based on <a href="#gameDependencies">game dependencies</a>. These

                                        For the most part, you have to choose what day you want the game to be added to before you add the game.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        If the current cell isn't in a <eltRef>Team</eltRef> column, then <prodRef>BracketBuilder</prodRef> will guess which day you are
                                        trying to insert into.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        If you are in a <eltRef>Score</eltRef> column, then it will guess you mean the day
                                        that starts in the column immediately to the left. For example, if you have selected column E (which is a <eltRef>score</eltRef>
                                        column), then it will assume you mean to insert into column D.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        If you are in a <eltRef>Line</eltRef> column (one of the very narrow columns that is used to draw the game lines), then
                                        it will guess you mean the day that starts in the column immediately to the right. For example, if you have selected column F,
                                        then it will assume you mean to insert into column G. (It makes this assumption because visually, that Line column looks like it
                                        is under the <em>next</em> day, not the previous day)

                                        If a game is the first game in the bracket for two teams, or if both the top and bottom teams for the game
                                        come from the losers of the preceding game, then the team has no incoming dependencies.
                                        If the winner of this game advances to a game that is not already on the bracket, then the game has no
                                        outgoing dependency either.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        When a game has no incoming or outgoing dependencies, then the game has very few restrictions about where it will
                                        be placed. The game will be placed in the <skimmable>next available</skimmable> location on that day. To figure this
                                        out, it looks at all the games on the bracket and tries to avoid being too close to anything already on the bracket.

                                        One thing that it considers is where future games <em>might</em> show up on the bracket. It will avoid these

                                        Every game has two teams (top and bottom). Most of these top/bottom teams come from the results of a previous game. One or both of these
                                        teams are the winners from a previous game, then <prodRef>BracketBuilder</prodRef> will draw a connecting line between the result of
                                        the game and the game being inserted. These are incoming dependencies.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        When you place a game that has incoming dependencies, then it will try its hardest to make sure the connecting lines really do connect
                                        between the games.

                                        Every game (except the champion) has a winner and feeds into another game on the bracket. If you add a game to the bracket that already
                                        has its outgoing dependency on the bracket, then the game will be placed so it feeds into that game.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This doesn't usually happen when you are building a bracket, but if you remove a game for some reason from the middle of the bracket, when you
                                        add it back (maybe on a different day?), then it will try to reconnect all the dependencies.

                                        For the very first game placed in the bracket, you don't have to select the day. For example, if you just leave cell A1 selected, when you
                                        insert the first game, then you selection will get automatically moved to the first day of the tournament. This is the only time
                                        <prodRef>BracketBuilder</prodRef> will jump to a particular day to play a game. Maybe a future release will automatically move the selection
                                        to the next day automatically when a game can't be placed, but for now you have to manually move the selection to the next day.

                                When you create the bracket workbook, all of the games are played at 12:00am (midnight) on a field called <em>Ballfield</em>.
                                Clearly this isn't real, but we have to start somewhere.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The games on the bracket all get their <eltRef>Field</eltRef> and <eltRef>Time</eltRef> information from the <eltRef>TeamsAndFields</eltRef>
                                sheet. This means you can update all the Fields and Times for each game by just changing the <eltRef>TeamsAndFields</eltRef> sheet.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The problem with having everything on the <eltRef>TeamsAndFields</eltRef> sheet is that it can be hard to tell the games apart when
                                just looking at them, especially before the games have been added to the bracket. To make this process a little easier, 
                                <prodRef>BracketBuilder</prodRef> will assign different fields and times to each game based on some basic rules.
                            </p>

                                        On the <eltRef>Games</eltRef> sheet, one of the Tournament Information items is the number of fields in the tournament. By default,
                                        the tournament has 2 fields. If you want a different number of fields automatically used, change this number <em>before</em>
                                        you start adding games.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        When you insert a game, <prodRef>BracketBuilder</prodRef> will try to figure out what the <em>next</em> field should be. It does
                                        this by looking at the latest game played on that day, and then it looks at the largest field number used (Field #1, Field #2, etc). 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        After it knows the last field used in the last time slot of the day, it will figure out if it can use another field at that time slot, or if
                                        it has to advance to a new time slot. For example, if the tournament has 3 fields and the last game was at 1:00pm on Field #2, then we can
                                        play another 1:00pm game on Field #3.  If the last game was already on Field #3, then we would have to move to a later time slot (slots are
                                        3 hours long), which would be 4:00pm on Field #1.
                                    </p>

                                    <prodRef>BracketBuilder</prodRef> isn't trying to get the fields and times corrent as you insert the games. All its trying to do
                                    is make it obvious which games are which when you look at the <eltRef>TeamsAndFields</eltRef> sheet.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    After you create the bracket, you should be able to quickly replace "Field #1" with the correct field name. Likewise, if your
                                    Saturday games start at 10:00am and are 3.5 hours long, then you can replace all the 9:00am games with 10:00am, all of the 12:00pm
                                    games with 1:30pm, and so on.

                                Each game has two teams playing. With the exception of the first game for each team, each of these teams
                                comes from a previous game -- either the winner or the loser of that game. BracketBuilder will
                                connect the winner of a game with the next game that the winning team will play.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The bracket is laid out with each column as a day of the week. (Actually, you can have more
                                than one column for a day, but we'll cover that later). Each game will be in one of those columns
                                in the bracket. This means that every game has to be placed in a column <i>after</i> all of the games
                                that feed into it. These are called the <i>game dependencies</i>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For example, if Game 19 is played between the winner of game 15 (W15) and the winner of game 13 (W13),
                                then Game 19 has to be in a column <i>after</i> both games 15 and 13. If you try to place a game in the
                                same column as one of its dependencies, then BracketBuilder will tell you it can't insert the game, and it
                                will suggest what column you have to put the game in.

                                Lots of commands can't be run until you have create a bracket first. For example, you can't
                                apply the finishing touches to a bracket if you haven't created the bracket yet.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you get an error telling you that a command isn't available until the bracket is ready, then you just have
                                to create the bracket
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you are getting this error and you DO have a bracket already created, then this means that something
                                in the workbook is broken and <prodRef>BracketBuidler</prodRef> doesn't recognize the workbook any more. At this
                                point its probably best to just start over and create a new bracket.

                                        If you already filled out your team names, then just copy the names from your old sheet to your new workbook.

                                There is no way to place a game in the same column as one of its dependencies. There is nothing that says
                                you can't have more than one column for any given day, though. In fact, we do this already when we extend
                                the last day of the tournament to include the <i>champion</i> game (which isn't really a game, its just
                                the fancy place we put the name of the tournament champion).

                                Someday, maybe we'll make a bracket command to make a day take up more columns, but for now its a manual
                                process. This is also a good step-by-step guide on how you can really tweak the schedule!

                                        as the championship game as a double-header.  We want the championship game at 3pm and the what-if
                                        will be at 6pm.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        To do this, we are going to merge two of the days together in the header so that a single day now has
                                        two columns. We also have to fix the day formulas. There are several steps:
                                    </p>
                                    <br clear="all" />
                                    <steps>

                                        <p>
                                            First, determine which days you want to merge. You can merge as many days as you want, but this example
                                            will only demonstrate two days.
                                        </p>
                                    </steps>
                                    <steps>

                                        <p>
                                            Select the two cells for the day-of-week to merge. You have to merge the day-of-the week cells (Monday/Tuesday/Wednesday)
                                            and the date cells (June 19, June 20, June 21) separately, so for the first step, only select the day-of-the-week cells.
                                        </p>
                                    </steps>

                                            On the home tab, find <cmd>Merge and center</cmd> button on the alignment chunk -- it should be in the
                                            depressed state, showing that the current selection is already merged. Click on <cmd>Merge and center</cmd> to unmerge
                                            the cells.
                                        </p>

                                            After the day-of-the-week cells are unmerged, you should still have the cells selected which will make it easier to
                                            merge both days all together. If all the cells aren't selected, that's ok -- you just have to reselect them. Be sure
                                            to select <em>all</em> of the cell between the lines (in this example, select M5:Q5)
                                        </p>
                                    </steps>

                                            Now we want to merge both days together. With the cells selected from the previous step, click the
                                            <cmdMerge and center</cmd> button again.  When you do this, you will get an Excel warning about
                    merging contents, click OK. We will fix up the formulas in the next step.

                                            With the day-of-week and the date cells merged together, we have now created multiple columns for
                                            a single day. Unfortunately, that warning that Excel gave about merging cells actually mattered.
                                            When we merged the cells, we broke the date formulas for the later days.
                                            To fix this, we have to fixup the formula for the broken day.<br /><br />Click on the cell with the broken date (S6 in this example)

                                When you get an error about the bracket being broken, there's not a lot you can do to fix it. This error
                                means that something internal on the workbook has become broken or inconsistent. It might be that a part
                                of a game didn't get inserted, or a game was partially removed. It also could be that a game ended up getting
                                inserted on top of another game.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you are really daring, you can try to erase the parts of the bracket that are confusing things. If you want to
                                do this, make sure to clear not just the contents of the cells, but also the names of the cells (remember that
                                BracketBuilder uses named cells in order to keep track of where games are on the bracket). Selecting cells
                                and using the <a href="./Commands.html#RemoveGame">button</a> might help you do this.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When all else fails, sometimes its just easier to start over with a new bracket. When you do this, make sure you
                                insert games in the places you want them to be in (since you now know where you want them).

                                out where to place the game. One thing it can't figure out on its own is what day to place the game on. (Actually,
                                for the very first game of the tournament, it will automatically put the game on the first day).

                                in the column for the day you want the game to be on. If you click at the top of the column, then <prodRef>BracketBuilder</prodRef>
                                will automatically pick what it thinks is the best spot for the game. If you click somewhere else in the column, then
                                it will try to place the game as close to that position as possible

                                possible to format the connecting lines and create the bracket you see. The repeating columns are pretty easy to see
                                since each set of 3 columns make up a day in the tournament. To find the repeating row pattern, look for the really short
                                rows on the sheet -- by default, these start with Row 11.

                                catch all for all of these failures. Hopefully the error message gives you some more details about what you can do
                                to fix the problem.

                                        For example, a game might fail because <prodRef>BracketBuilder</prodRef> can't insert the game without the new game
                                        overlapping an existing game already on the bracket. In many cases, it can adjust the bracket to make things fit, but
                                        it only knows so many tricks.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The error message should tell you where on the grid the overlapping game or line is. To fix it, you will probably have
                                        to remove games (or use <cmd>Undo</cmd>) to get back to a poing when you can start adding games back in a different
                                        order, or at different places (by <a href="./FAQ.html#manuallySelect">manually selecting</a> the game location).
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Remember, if the bracket was automatically reorganized earlier, it will probably be best to use <cmd>Undo</cmd> since
                                        that will also undo the bracket adjustments
                                    </p>

                                        One of the things that <prodRef>BracketBuilder</prodRef> checks when inserting a game is whether or not an existing
                                        game on the bracket is going to have a line coming out of it to another game. It knows that every game (except the
                                        champion) has to connect to another game later in the bracket. These connection lines can't cross over another game,
                                        so <prodRef>BracketBuilder</prodRef> uses this information to make sure it doesn't put any future games in the bracket
                                        in a place that would overlap.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        For example, if you have a game between the two games that need to play each other, when you try to place that next game,
                                        the insert will fail because the result of that game in the middle would run into the game you are about to place. To fix this,
                                        you have to either remove the game in the middle, or rearrange the grid so the two games that feed into the next game are next to
                                        each other.  NOTE: in reality, <prodRef>BracketBuilder</prodRef> knows how to fix this particular example and would automatically
                                        rearrange the grid for you. But in a bigger bracket, with more games already played, it probably won't be able to fix it
                                        automatically.

                                        Every game can have up to two lines, or feeders, coming in to it. These are the winning teams from previous games. Every game
                                        also has an outgoing feeder, which is the winner of the game. When <prodRef>BracketBuilder</prodRef> tries to place games,
                                        it uses what it knows about the bracket structure to connect games with incoming and outgoing feeders. If the games on the
                                        bracket are placed in a way that makes it impossible to connect games with their sources or results, then you will
                                        get an error about not being able to connect feeder lines.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Unfortunately, the only way to fix this at this point is to either <cmd>Undo</cmd> or remove games to the point where
                                        you can manually place games to make things work. Alternatively, you can just start over with a clean bracket and use
                                        what you know about how the bracket is going to lay out in order to manually choose places for the games to go.

                                By default, <prodRef>BracketBuilder</prodRef> knows how to make standard double-elimination tournament
                                brackets compatible with Little League. You can find lots of details of creating your own custom brackets
                                <a href="./CustomBrackets.html">here</a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Little League also supports a <em>Modified Double Eliminiation</em> bracket where the tournament progress like a standard
                                double elimination, but the championship game is a winner-take-all game. There is no what-if game. This means that if the
                                undefeated team loses the championship game, then the tournament is still over even though that team only lost one game
                                in the tournament.
                            </p>
                            The easiest way to accomplish this is to start with a standard bracket and make a small change to the bracket definition.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                First, lets start with a 5 team double elimination bracket. Start out by selecting a 5 Team bracket and build it. You will get all the
                                expected sheets (Games, TeamsAndFields, BracketInfo, and BracketDefs). To make this a modified double elimination bracket, we will
                                be changing the BracketDefs sheet.
                            </p>
                            <p>If you go to the BracketDefs sheet, you should see the definition for the 5 team double elimination bracket as shown.</p>
                            <p>In order to make this a modified double elimination bracket, we will be getting rid of the the what-if game in the tournament.</p>
                            <p>
                                Look at game 8 in the bracket. The Winner is defined to go to the Top of Game 9 and the Loser goes to the Bottom of Game 9. In a modified
                                bracket, the loser of Game 8 goes nowhere -- they are eliminated. Let's delete the B9 value in the Loser column of game 8. This makes
                                game 8 our championship game now.
                            </p>
                            <zoomable>
                                <floatRight style="width: 20vw">
                                    <img src="Images/BracketDefMod.png" class="whiteBackSmaller" />
                                </floatRight>
                            </zoomable>
                            <p>
                                The next change is to make Game 9 our champion. Delete The T10 from the Winner column of Game 9, and delete L8 from the Bottom
                                column for Game 9. This means that Game 9 has no winner or loser advance values, and it also means that there is no bottom
                                team defined for Game 9. This makes this our champion.
                            </p>
                            <p>The last thing to do is to delete the Game 10 line entirely since it is no longer needed. Just delete the whole row.</p>
                            <p>
                                Now we have a modified double elimination bracket for 5 teams. Go back to the Games sheet, and right click on the
                                <prodRef>BracketBuilder</prodRef> add in and Refresh it. (In Excel on the Desktop, just choose Refresh. In Excel on the Web,
                                choose "Refresh Frame"). This will cause the addin to reload the bracket.
                            </p>
