    <p> Making tournament brackets can be tedious, mostly because you get bogged
      down in making sure the formatting works and you don't <i>cross the lines</i>.
      TwBracketBuilder tries to help here. </p>
    <h2> Compatibility </h2>
    <p> This add-in creates double-elimination tournament brackets that conform
      to Little League's tournament brackets. If you intend to use these for a
      Little League tournament, remember they must be approved before they are
      used. </p>
    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>First you will have to select the size of your bracket and build the
      bracket. </p>
    <p>Once you click "Build a bracket",your workbook will be setup to start
      building out your bracket.</p>

    <p>Let's get familiar with the bracket and how it's built.</p>
    <h3>BUILDING</h3>
    <p>The cell at the top (A1) is the "BUILDING" cell. When "BUILDING" is in
      the cell, then every game will show the source for the game (W1 or L3, for
      example). Otherwise, it will be blank until the bracket starts filling in
      to that game. Play with it.</p>
    <h3>Header Text</h3>
    <p>The name of the tournament, description, address, etc, are all at the top
      of the bracket grid. Eventually you will want to merge and center this
      text across your entire bracket. Since we don't know how many days the
      tournament will run (yet),we just let this be a single cell for now.</p>
    <p>All of this text can be filled out on the TournamentInfo sheet. Just go
      there and fill in the details for your tournament.&nbsp; NOTE: if you want
      a field to be blank,then enter a single ' in the field.</p>
    <h3>Grid Pattern</h3>
    <p>This grid is carefully constructed to allow lines to connect games and
      create visual affects. You can change things like row height and column
      widths, but don't change the pattern.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Rows are in pairs: a full height row for text, and a 1 pixel row for
        lines. You can see this when you look at the row numbers on the left
        side -- they seem to count by twos in the grid (10, 12, 14, 16). The odd
        number rows aren't missing, they are just really short. Those short rows
        give us the lines.</li>
      <li>Columns are in threes:&nbsp; A wide column for team names, a narrow
        column for game score, and a 1 pixel column for lines. Notice that the
        column with "Team 1" in it is wider than the score column next to it.
        The line column is even smaller.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Games on the Grid</h3>
    <p>Each game has several components.</p>
    <h4>Team Names</h4>
    <p>All games have a top and bottom team name. If these are first round
      games, then the seeded team name will be entered. By default these will
      say "Team 1", etc. You can either type in the correct team name, or you
      can go to the "TeamsAndFields" sheet and fill in the team names there.
      Either way, the team names will automatically update throughout the
      bracket as you enter scores into the bracket.</p>
    <h4>Game Info Block</h4>
    <p>The Game Info Block has the field number, game time, and any special text
      (like "Loser to T6"). To change the field or time of the game, you can
      either type the correct information directly into the block, or you can go
      to the "TeamsAndFields" sheet and fill in the game information there (just
      look up the game number). Either way, the actual game information on the
      "BracketInfo" sheet will automatically update to match what the grid says.
      (This makes it easy to bulk-upload the games to something like
      ArbiterSports when the bracket has been constructed).</p>
    <h4>Game Number Block</h4>
    <p>The game number block is just a merged set of cells with the game number
      in it ("G2", "G3", etc.)</p>
    <h3>Selecting<img src="GameSelected.png" alt="Selected Game structure screen clipping"
        style="width: 152px; height: 129px;" class="ScreenClip" align="right"></h3>
    <p>When we talk about choosing a place to insert a game, or choosing a day
      to insert a game into, you should always be putting your selection in the
      widest column -- the one that the team names go into.</p>
    <p>When we talk about selecting a game,you should select the top and bottom
      team names, AND include the line on the right (it is tricky to select
      without using Shift+Right Arrow</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2> Placing Games </h2>
    <h3><img src="Taskpane.png" alt="Selected Game structure screen clipping" style="width: 140px; height: 312px;"
        class="ScreenClip" align="right"></h3>
    <p> Once you have chosen the size of your bracket, you will see a list of
      games that need to be placed in your bracket. The games that are shaded
      gray are already in your bracket, but you can still remove them by
      clicking the "-" button. The games that are not shaded still need to be
      placed in your grid. </p>
    <p> In many cases, the add-in can automagically place the game for you. For
      first-round games, it will choose the next available spot on the day you
      choose. As you get further in the bracket it will place games where they
      have to go in order for the lines to work. In some cases, where the grid
      has to be reorganized, it will even fixup the grid to make things work. </p>
    <p> To insert a game <i>automagically</i>, just select a cell in the day
      where you want the game. Its usually best to select a cell close to the
      top of the column so its clear you aren't trying to manually place the
      game. Then just click the "+" next to the game you want to insert. </p>
    <h3> Ok, it screwed up </h3>
    <p> Well, its not perfect. If you catch the mistake early (before you insert
      other games), you can just <i>undo</i> what you just did. <b>Don't use
        Excel's undo</b>. Use the undo button in the task pane. (You can also
      use redo to undo what you undid). You should be able to undo multiple
      things by clicking undo again. If clicking undo doesn't do anything, then
      you will have to remove the games manually </p>
    <p> To remove a game manually, first try just clicking the "-" next to the
      game you are trying to remove. If that doesn't work, then select the game
      in the grid and click the "Remove Game" button: <img src="RemoveGameIcon.png"
        alt="Remove Game Icon" style="width: 22px; height: 25px;"></p>
