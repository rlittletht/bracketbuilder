                        By default, <prodRef>BracketBuilder</prodRef> knows how to make standard double-elimination tournament
                        brackets compatible with Little League. All of these brackets are structured such that a team can be eliminated when
                        they have lost two games (hence, <em>double elimination</em>). Internally, however, brackets are really
                        just rules about where winners and losers come from and go to. There are a lot of predefined brackets
                        that it understands, but you can provide you're own bracket definitions as well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to provide your own bracket definitions, you have to follow very specific rules about how to
                        structure the bracket definition. When you create a bracket from a built-in definition, <prodRef>BracketBuilder</prodRef>
                        creates the bracket definition for you on the <em>BracketDefs</em> sheet. If you want to customize that bracket, you
                        can either modify the bracket on that sheet or you can create entirely new brackets.

                                Each bracket has a very specific format. You can see sample brackets at <a href="./BracketDefsSample.xlsx">Bracket Samples</a>. 
                                There is extra information in the definition table -- this is there to try to help you avoid common mistakes
                                when creating a bracket, like having multiple games feeding into the same game.

                                        You can define more than 1 bracket on your BracketDefs sheet, but you cannot use more than 200 rows on that sheet. (This is just
                                        an arbitrary limitation. If this isn't enough, feel free to email us at <a href="mailto:red@traynrex.com">red@traynrex.com</a>

                                        The row above the definition table has the <em>short name</em> for the bracket as well as the description for the bracket.
                                        The Bracket Chooser when you are getting started will list all of the built-in brackets along with the custom brackets that
                                        are defined on the BracketDefs sheet. The Bracket Short Name is what will be listed in the Bracket Chooser.

                                    <p>The description is purely informational and doesn't show up when you are building the bracket.</p>

                                        Every bracket definition table MUST BE NAMED, and the name MUST be of the form "T#Bracket" where # is the number of
                                        teams in the bracket. For exmple, for a 5 team bracket definition, that table MUST be named "T5Bracket". It doesn't matter
                                        if the definition is for a standard or modified double elimination bracket (or a completely different type of bracket) -- the
                                        name must always be "T#Bracket". It follows, then, that you cannot have more than one definition for each count of teams.

                                                Each line in the bracket definition describes a game. Each game has several parts -- the game number, winner and loser advance
                                                details, top and bottom sources, and counts that help you avoid making invalid brackets.

                                                Each game has a game number. This number will show up on the bracket when you place games. It is also used whenever
                                                you are referring to the winner/loser of a particular game. For example, the winner of game 1 is "W1". The loser of game
                                                1 is "L1"

                                                Each game has a winner and a loser. The bracket definition for a game defines where the winner and the loser of the
                                                game will advance to.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>The winner of every game MUST advance to another game in the bracket.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                The loser of a game might advance to another game (if it is that team's first loss), or it might be blank. If the Loser Advances to
                                                is blank for a game, that means that the losing team for that game is eliminated.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                The championship game in the bracket will have BOTH the Winning and Losing teams advancing nowehere. When both of these values
                                                are blank, <prodRef>BracketBuilder</prodRef> will format that game as a final champion.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Most tournaments have a single champion, but you can have as many champions as you want in a tournament -- each one will
                                                have their Winner and Loser advances to values be blank. The Little League World Series, for example, has two champions -- the
                                                overall champion, and the 3rd place champion

                                                Each game has a top and bottom team, and these teams have to come from somewhere. Each game definition has to specify where
                                                these teams come from.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                The first round games of the tournament will have <em>static</em> team names, like "Team 1" and "Team 2". Every team in
                                                the tournament will be listed in the bracket only once, for their first game of the tournemnt.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                All other games will specify <em>where</em> the team will come from. For example, Game 3 in the five team bracket
                                                has the top team coming from the Winner of Game 1, and the bottom team is Team 5 (since Team 5 has a by in this
                                                tournament). Game 6, for example, has the top team coming from the winner of Game 4 and the bottom team coming from
                                                the Loser of Game 3.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>The champion(s) will only have the top team defined, and the bottom team will be left blank.</p>

                                            <p>
                                                These cells show how many times this game number shows up as a Winner or Loser advances to in this bracket.
                                                For example, Game 1 will never show up as a Winner or Loser advances to since No Game advances to Game 1. In a 5 team
                                                bracket, Game 4 shows up as the Loser of Game 1 advances to B4 and the Loswer of Game 2 advances to T4. This means that
                                                the CountTopCheck will be 1 (because loser Game 2 advances to T4) and the CountBottomCheck will be 1 (because loser Game1 advances
                                                to B4). Each of these counts should be 1 except for the games where the teams are <em>static</em>.

                                The team check row shows the count of teams expected and the calculated count of teams defined in the bracket. These
                                two values should be the same
                            </p>

                                The loss check row shows the expected number of "loser advances to" values in the table and the actual count of
                                "loser advances to". These values should be the same <em>except</em> in a modified double elimination bracket. In the
                                modified bracket, there is no what-if game, which means there will be one fewer "loser advances to" values in the
                                bracket.

                                The Win Check shows the expected number of "winner advances to" values in the table and the actual count. These values
                                should be the same.

                                If you add the <prodRef>BracketBuilder</prodRef> add-in to a workbook that already has a correctly
                                formatted BracketDefs sheet, then the custom brackets will be automatically recognized and listed
                                in the Bracket Chooser. You will also have an additional Button on the Welcome page to load the custom
                                brackets -- this is helpful to reload your custom brackets as you work through issues. Every time it tries
                                to load a custom bracket it will validate it and report any errors. You can correct these errors and
                                try to reload the bracket
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The example image shows what the <prodRef>BracketBuilder</prodRef> looks like when you add it to
                                the <a href="./SingleEliminationDefinitions.xlsx">Single Elimination Bracket Definitions</a> workbook. All 16
                                definitions are loaded and available to build.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Another way to load a custom bracket is to create a built-in bracket for the number of teams you want
                                (like a 5 team bracket), then go to the BracketDefs sheet and modify the bracket. If you reload
                                <prodRef>BracketBuidler</prodRef>, then the modified bracket will get loaded.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To reload, right click on the
                                <prodRef>BracketBuilder</prodRef> add in pane and Refresh it. (In Excel on the Desktop, just choose Refresh. In Excel on the Web,
                                choose "Refresh Frame"). This will cause the addin to reload the bracket.
