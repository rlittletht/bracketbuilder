            <h2><a name="Advanced">Editing the Sheet</a></h2>
            <p>
                Here we are going to go into more depth explaining <em>how</em> things work along with the underlying
                structure in the worksheet. The goal is for you to understand how to fine-tune the bracket
                without breaking the underlying formulas/formatting
            </p>
            <floatRight style="width: 20vw;padding-top: 2rem"><img class="whiteBack" src="./GameOnGrid.png" /></floatRight>
            <h3><a name="structure">Sheet Structure</a></h3>
            <p>
                The bracket is laid out on a grid in the worksheet. Each game relies on the underlying
                formatting of this grid.
            <p>
                Each game requires a minimum of 9 rows (though 11 rows is recommended). These rows alternate between
                <em>content</em> rows and <em>border/line</em> rows, which is why we need so many rows for a game.
                For an 11 row game, you have:
                <ol>
                    <li>Top Team Name</li>
                    <li>Top game line</li>
                    <li>Loser advances to note</li>
                    <li>(blank line row)</li>
                    <li>Field</li>
                    <li>(blank line row)</li>
                    <li>Time</li>
                    <li>(blank line row)</li>
                    <li>blank content line)</li>
                    <li>Bottom game line</li>
                    <li>Bottom team name</li>
                </ol>
                <floatRight style="width: 20vw"><img class="whiteBack" src="./GameOnGrid-Columns.png" /></floatRight>
                Even when there is no content or no line, the rows continue to alternate. This allows games to
                be placed anywhere on the grid.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each game always requires at least 3 columns. BracketBuilder will never create a game with other than 3 columns, but you
                will learn later that there are things you can do to customize your bracket that will keep the structure working
                while still letting you get creative.
            </p>
            <p>
                These three columns consists of a <em>description</em> column (for the team name, field, time, etc.), a
                <em>game number</em> column, and a <em>border/line</em> column. Just like with the rows, this pattern repeats
                even if there is no content.
            </p>
            <floatRight style="width: 30vw;padding-top: 2rem"><img src="GameAnatomy.png" class="whiteBack" /></floatRight>
            <h3><a name="anatomy" />Game Formulas</h3>
            <p>
                Most of the parts of a game come from formulas and cell names, which make it possible for the games to automatically
                update with winners/losers as scores are entered.
            </p>
            <h4><a name="teamName" />Team Name</h4>
            <p> There is a team name at the top and bottom of every game</p>
            <p>
                The first game for each team is a little special -- the team name
                comes from the TeamsAndFields sheet, where there is a table that maps team numbers to their team name. If you want
                to change the name of a team, you can edit the team name on the TeamsAndFields sheet <b>OR</b> you can just type
                the team name into the cell. When you type the name of the team directly on the bracket sheet, the game will be
                marked as "dirty" so you can update the TeamsAndFields sheet later (more on this later in <em>Updating bracket with changes</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                For all of the other games in the bracket, the team name will be automatically filled in based on who won or lost
                in the bracket. These cells also have a name assigned to them identifies the
                cell for later games in the bracket. <b>DO NOT EDIT</b> these team names.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can format the team names however you like, but DO NOT merge the team name cells with any other cells.
            </p>
            <p>
                While you are building the bracket, you will see things like "W1" or "L1" which means that the team
                name is the winner of game 1, or the loser of game 1. When you are done building the bracket, you might want to remove
                those W1/L1 designations for a cleaner bracket. To do this, just delete the word "BUILDING" in cell A1 on the sheet.
            </p>
            <h4><a name="score" />Score</h4>
            <p>
                Every game has score cells for the top and bottom teams. As you fill in these scores, later bracket games
                will automatically update with the winners/losers of each game.
            </p>
            <p>
                Enter only numbers into these score cells. You can format them however you like, but DO NOT merge the score cell
                with any other cells.
            </p>
            <h4><a name="field" />Field/Time</h4>
            <p>
                Each game has a field cell and a time cell that shows the field and time that the game is. This field and time
                information come from
                the TeamsAndFields sheet and the bracket will automatically update when you make changes.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also edit the field and time information directly on the bracket by just typing into the cell. When you edit
                the field or time information directly on the bracket, the game will be marked as dirty.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>BE CAREFULL!</b> If you copy/paste field or time information, you will probably end up copying <em>the formula</em> instead
                of the actual text, which means the information will be wrong when you edit the bracket info sheet. Its best
                to avoid copy/paste unless you are sure you are just copying/pasting text.
            </p>
            <h4><a name="gameNum" />Game Number</h4>
            <p>
                The game number is automatically filled in for each game. The several cells are merged together so the game number
                will show up positioned properly within the game.
            </p>
            <h3><a name="editable" />What's Safe to edit?</h3>
            <p>
                The previous section described all the special things about the games -- formulas and cell names. For the most
                part, any blank cell can be filled in with whatever you want. BracketBuilder won't know that its there, so it
                might insert something on top of it, but it won't break the underlying structure. Once your bracket is built,
                you are pretty much free to add whatever decorations you want (logos, pictures, etc.)
            </p>
            <h4><a name="moving" />Moving Games Manually</h4>
            <p>
                In other sections, we talk about using the addin to move games (pick them up and put them somewhere else),
                or even removing the game from the bracket and adding it on a new day. But what if the addin just won't
                do what you want, or if you want to move the game in a special way? You can do that as long as you keep
                the underlying formulas and names in-tact.
            </p>
            <p>
                The best way to do this is use <em>cut and paste</em>. By cutting the cells and pasting them, you are
                guaranteeing that the formulas remain intact and you don't get name conflicts on the sheet.
                If the paste doesn't work out the way you want, you can always use Excel's Undo feature to go back to where you were.
            </p>
            <p>
                NOTE: When you cut and paste, make sure you select the entire game, from the top team name to the border line cell
                next to the bottom team name. This will ensure that you have all 3 columns included. When you paste, make sure you
                select the right cell for the top team name.
            </p>
            <h4><a name="lines" />Borders/Lines</h4>
            <p>
                If you want to manually connect (or extend) a line in the bracket, the easiest way is to copy a line cell
                (which is really just a cell in a line column or line row which is filled with the Black color). If you copy
                an existing line cell and then paste after you select the cells that connect or draw the border you want.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want to erase a line or border, just select the cells for the line/border and change the fill color
                to none. This will effectively erase the border or line
            </p>
            <h4><a name="what-if" />Deleting the What-If Game</h4>
            <p>
                In a double elimination bracket, teams are only eliminated after losing two games. This applies to the
                championship game as well. The championship game is played between the team that has won every game (no losses),
                and the team that has only one loss. This means that if the team with no losses loses the championship
                game, then that is their first loss. Since they have to lose two games to be eliminated, there has to be
                one final game (referred to as the <em>what-if</em> or <em>if necessary</em> game). When you build a bracket,
                it will get marked as "if first loss".
            </p>
            <p>
                There's a 50/50 chance that the what-if game will actually need to be played. Often the team with no losses will
                win the championship game, which means there is no need for a what-if game. If you want to clean up the bracket,
                you can delete the what-if game. We also want to reformat the game so it fills all of the space that the
                championship and what-if games were taking up.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are a few steps to take to do this:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Select the cell with "Champion" in it cut and paste it under the winning teams name (the cell will have "if first loss" in it)</li>
                <li>Select all the cells you want to clear out (don't include the Champion label you just pasted) and clear the cells (use Delete key)</li>
                <li>
                    Select all the cells you want to remove borders/lines from (don't include the line underneath the winning team's name)
                    and fill the cells with <em>No fill</em>
                </li>

                    so you extend the line to reach the end of the space, and paste
                </li>
