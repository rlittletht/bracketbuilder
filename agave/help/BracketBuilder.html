            <p>
                Making tournament brackets like this one can be tedious -- you have to figure out which games
                have to play on which days, and you get bogged
                down in making sure the formatting works and that you don't <i>cross the lines</i>. It doesn't
                help that the recommended double-elimination brackets for Little League can be a little
                hard to follow.
            </p>

            <p>
                Bracket Builder addresses all of these problems. Every game in the bracket
                conforms to the double-elimination bracket, and every time you add a game,
                it will format the cells to connect the games. It will even adjust your
                entire bracket to avoid the most common bracket building headaches, namely
                things like reordering games to make games fit without crossing lines.
            </p>
            <p>
                When your bracket is built and you have <i>applied the finishing touches</i>,
                you can add scores to the bracket and the team names will automatically fill
                in as you progress through the bracket. This is very helpful if you want to export
                the bracket to a PDF and post it to the web to keep everyone up to date.
            </p>
            <p>
                Go through these help topics to first get started with your first bracket, and then
                dive into the advanced topics to learn how to tweak your bracket without breaking
                things.

                First, a note able these brackets and their compatibility. This add-in creates double-elimination
                tournament brackets that conform
                to Little League's Approved Double Elimination Tournament Brackets. If you intend to use these for a
                Little League tournament, remember they must still be approved in order to be used in the
                Little League tournament. This add-in just helps you create and format the bracket.

            <img src="Images/ChooseSize.png" alt="SetupExample" class="ScreenClip" style="width: 256px; height: 271px"
                 align="right">
            <p>
                Ok, there's a lot of details we could go into, but let's just do a quick
                walk-through to get you used to it.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Create a new workbook and insert the adding (Insert Tab, Get Add-ins,
                    My Organization, TwBracketBuilder)
                </li>
                <li>Choose "9 Team" and click Build a bracket to setup your workbook.</li>
                <li>
                    Select G6 and type "6/25/22" - this is the start of our tournament
                    (notice that all the dates changed for the rest of the tournament)
                </li>
                <li>Select cell G7 (because we want to insert on Saturday 8/21)</li>
                <li>
                    Insert game 1 (Click "+" for game 1
                    <img src="Images/Game1.png" alt="game 1 picture"
                         style="width: 136px; height: 25px;">)
                </li>
                <li>Insert game 2</li>
                <li>Insert game 3</li>
                <li>Insert game 4</li>
                <li>Select cell J7 (so we insert games on 8/22 now)</li>
                <li>
                    Insert game 5 (notice that the grid adjusted to make space for the
                    game)
                </li>
                <li>Insert game 9 (since G2 and G3 played on Saturday)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                At this point, we can't fit any more games on Sunday because G8 requires
                G6, and G10 required G5 &amp; G4
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Select M7 (for Monday)</li>
                <li>Insert game 8</li>
                <li>Insert game 10</li>
            </ul>
            Ok, that looks a little funky. Maybe we could do better. <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Click Undo <img src="Images/UndoIcon.png" alt="Undo Icon" style="width: 22px; height: 25px;">twice.
                    Game 10 and game 8 should be gone now
                </li>
                <li>(Make sure M7 is still selected)</li>
                <li>Insert game 10</li>
                <li>Insert game 8</li>
            </ul>
            Ok, that looks better...
            <ul>
                <li>Select P7 (for Tuesday)</li>
                <li>Insert game 11</li>
                <li>Insert game 12</li>
                <li>Select S7</li>
                <li>Insert game 13</li>
                <li>Insert game 14</li>
                <li>Select V7</li>
                <li>Insert game 15</li>
                <li>Select Y7</li>
                <li>Insert game 16</li>
                <li>Select AB7</li>
                <li>Insert game 17</li>
                <li>Select AE 7</li>
                <li>Insert champion (game 18)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                At this point, the bracket is done. Now let's go back and fix the team
                names. Go to the TeamsAndFields sheet. Fill out the team names for the
                bracket (fill in cells B23 to B31with team names).
            </p>
            <p>
                Now back on the Games sheet, you can click on each "Field #1" or "6:00
                PM" and put the correct field and time. (You could also do this on the
                TeamsAndFields sheet).
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, let's fill in some tournament information. Go to the
                "TournamentInfo" sheet:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Select B1, enter "9 Team Tournament"</li>
                <li>Select B2, enter "Sample Walkthrough"</li>
                <li>Select B3, enter "Al Houghton Stadium"</li>
                <li>Select B4, enter "Little League Dr, San Bernardino, CA"</li>
                <li>Select B5, enter "Hosted by Little League"</li>
            </ul>
            And there you go... A completed bracket!<br>
            <h2>Detailed Instructions</h2>
            <p></p>
            <h2><a name="compat">Compatibility </a></h2>
            <p>
                This add-in creates double-elimination tournament brackets that conform
                to Little League's tournament brackets. If you intend to use these for a
                Little League tournament, remember they must be approved before they are
                used.
            </p>
            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>
                First you will have to select the size of your bracket and build the
                bracket.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you click "Build a bracket",your workbook will be setup to start
                building out your bracket.
            </p>
            <img src="Images/GridAndTaskpane.png" alt="Grid and taskpane screen clipping" class="ScreenClip"
                 style="width: 701px; height: 295px;" align="right"> <br clear="right">
            <p>Let's get familiar with the bracket and how it's built.</p>
            <h3>BUILDING</h3>
            <p>
                The cell at the top (A1) is the "BUILDING" cell. When "BUILDING" is in
                the cell, then every game will show the source for the game (W1 or L3, for
                example). Otherwise, it will be blank until the bracket starts filling in
                to that game. Play with it.
            </p>
            <h3>Header Text</h3>
            <p>
                The name of the tournament, description, address, etc, are all at the top
                of the bracket grid. Eventually you will want to merge and center this
                text across your entire bracket. Since we don't know how many days the
                tournament will run (yet),we just let this be a single cell for now.
            </p>
            <p>
                All of this text can be filled out on the TournamentInfo sheet. Just go
                there and fill in the details for your tournament.&nbsp; NOTE: if you want
                a field to be blank,then enter a single ' in the field.
            </p>
            <h3>Grid Pattern</h3>
            <p>
                This grid is carefully constructed to allow lines to connect games and
                create visual affects. You can change things like row height and column
                widths, but don't change the pattern.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Rows are in pairs: a full height row for text, and a 1 pixel row for
                    lines. You can see this when you look at the row numbers on the left
                    side -- they seem to count by twos in the grid (10, 12, 14, 16). The odd
                    number rows aren't missing, they are just really short. Those short rows
                    give us the lines.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Columns are in threes:&nbsp; A wide column for team names, a narrow
                    column for game score, and a 1 pixel column for lines. Notice that the
                    column with "Team 1" in it is wider than the score column next to it.
                    The line column is even smaller.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <img src="Images/GameStructure.png" alt="Game structure screen clipping" style="width: 245px; height: 208px;"
                 class="ScreenClip" align="right">
            <h3>Games on the Grid</h3>
            <p>Each game has several components.</p>
            <h4>Team Names</h4>
            <p>
                All games have a top and bottom team name. If these are first round
                games, then the seeded team name will be entered. By default these will
                say "Team 1", etc. You can either type in the correct team name, or you
                can go to the "TeamsAndFields" sheet and fill in the team names there.
                Either way, the team names will automatically update throughout the
                bracket as you enter scores into the bracket.
            </p>
            <h4>Game Info Block</h4>
            <p>
                The Game Info Block has the field number, game time, and any special text
                (like "Loser to T6"). To change the field or time of the game, you can
                either type the correct information directly into the block, or you can go
                to the "TeamsAndFields" sheet and fill in the game information there (just
                look up the game number). Either way, the actual game information on the
                "TeamsAndFields" sheet will automatically update to match what the grid says.
                (This makes it easy to bulk-upload the games to something like
                ArbiterSports when the bracket has been constructed).

            <h4>Game Number Block</h4>
            <p>
                The game number block is just a merged set of cells with the game number
                in it ("G2", "G3", etc.)

            <p>
                When we talk about choosing a place to insert a game, or choosing a day
                to insert a game into, you should always be putting your selection in the
                widest column -- the one that the team names go into.
            </p>
            <p>
                When we talk about selecting a game,you should select the top and bottom
                team names, AND include the line on the right (it is tricky to select
                without using Shift+Right Arrow
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <h2> Placing Games </h2>
            <h3>
                <img src="Images/Taskpane.png" alt="Selected Game structure screen clipping" style="width: 140px; height: 312px;"
                     class="ScreenClip" align="right">
            </h3>
            <p>
                Once you have chosen the size of your bracket, you will see a list of
                games that need to be placed in your bracket. The games that are shaded
                gray are already in your bracket, but you can still remove them by
                clicking the "-" button. The games that are not shaded still need to be
                placed in your grid.
            </p>
            <p>
                In many cases, the add-in can automagically place the game for you. For
                first-round games, it will choose the next available spot on the day you
                choose. As you get further in the bracket it will place games where they
                have to go in order for the lines to work. In some cases, where the grid
                has to be reorganized, it will even fixup the grid to make things work.
            </p>
            <p>
                To insert a game <i>automagically</i>, just select a cell in the day
                where you want the game. Its usually best to select a cell close to the
                top of the column so its clear you aren't trying to manually place the
                game. Then just click the "+" next to the game you want to insert.
            </p>
            <h3> Ok, it screwed up </h3>
            <p>
                Well, its not perfect. If you catch the mistake early (before you insert
                other games), you can just <i>undo</i> what you just did.
                <b>
                    Don't use
                    Excel's undo
                </b>. Use the undo button in the task pane:
                <img src="Images/UndoIcon.png"
                     alt="Undo Icon" style="width: 22px; height: 25px;"> (You can also use
                redo to undo what you undid). You should be able to undo multiple things
                by clicking undo again. If clicking undo doesn't do anything, then you
                will have to remove the games manually
            </p>
            <p>
                To remove a game manually, first try just clicking the "-" next to the
                game you are trying to remove. If that doesn't work, then select the game
                in the grid and click the "Remove Game" button:
                <img src="Images/RemoveGameIcon.png"
                     alt="Remove Game Icon" style="width: 22px; height: 25px;">
            </p>
