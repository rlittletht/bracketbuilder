                                Making tournament brackets like this one can be tedious -- you have to figure out which games
                                have to play on which days, and you get bogged
                                down in making sure the formatting works and that you don't <i>cross the lines</i>. It doesn't
                                help that the recommended double-elimination brackets for Little League can be a little
                                hard to follow.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Bracket Builder addresses all of these problems. Every game in the bracket
                                conforms to the double-elimination bracket, and every time you add a game,
                                it will format the cells to connect the games. It will even adjust your
                                entire bracket to avoid the most common bracket building headaches, namely
                                things like reordering games to make games fit without crossing lines.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When your bracket is built and you have <i>applied the finishing touches</i>,
                                you can add scores to the bracket and the team names will automatically fill
                                in as you progress through the bracket. This is very helpful if you want to export
                                the bracket to a PDF and post it to the web to keep everyone up to date.
                            </p>

                                Go through these help topics to first get started with your first bracket, and then
                                dive into the advanced topics to learn how to tweak your bracket without breaking
                                things.

                                First, a note able these brackets and their compatibility. This add-in creates double-elimination
                                tournament brackets that conform
                                to Little League's Approved Double Elimination Tournament Brackets. If you intend to use these for a
                                Little League tournament, remember they must still be approved in order to be used in the
                                Little League tournament. This add-in just helps you create and format the bracket.

                                Ok, there's a lot of details we could go into, but let's just do a quick
                                walk-through to get you used to it.
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Create a new workbook and insert the Add-In (Insert Tab, Get Add-ins,
                                    My Organization, BracketBuilder)
                                </li>
                                <li>Choose "9 Team" and click Build a bracket to setup your workbook.</li>
                                <li>
                                    Select D6 and type "6/25/22" - this is the start of our tournament
                                    (notice that all the dates changed for the rest of the tournament)
                                </li>
                                <li>Select cell D7 (because we want to insert on Saturday 6/25)</li>
                                <li>
                                    Insert game 1 (Click "+" for game 1
                                    <zoomableInline>
                                        <floatNone style="width: 136px">

                                    </zoomableInline>)
                                </li>
                                <li>Insert game 2</li>
                                <li>Insert game 3</li>
                                <li>Insert game 4</li>
                                <li>Select cell G7 (so we insert games on 6/26 now)</li>
                                <li>
                                    Insert game 5 (notice that the grid adjusted to make space for the
                                    game)
                                </li>
                                <li>Insert game 6 (since G1 and G2 played on Saturday)</li>
                                <li>Insert game 9</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                At this point, we can't fit any more games on Sunday because G7 requires G5, G8 requires
                                G6, and G10 requires G5. Since G5 and G6 play on Sunday, we can't play G7, G8, or G10 until
                                Monday.
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Select J7 (for Monday)</li>
                                <li>Insert game 7</li>
                                <li>Insert game 8</li>
                                <li>Insert game 10</li>
                            </ul>
                            Ok, that looks a little funky. Maybe we could do better.
                            <br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Click Undo
                                    <floatNone style="width: 22px;">
                                        <img src="Images/UndoIcon.png" class="whiteBack" style="max-width: 122px">

                                    three times. Games 10, 8, and 7 should be gone now.
                                </li>
                                <li>(Make sure J7 is still selected)</li>
                                <li>Insert game 8</li>
                                <li>Insert game 7</li>
                                <li>Insert game 10</li>
                            </ul>
                            Ok, that looks better... All we did was change the order we inserted the games and
                            <prodRef>BracketBuilder</prodRef> was able
                            to make a better guess about the position.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Select M7 (for Tuesday)</li>
                                <li>Insert game 11</li>
                                <li>Insert game 12</li>
                                <li>Select P7</li>
                                <li>Insert game 13</li>
                                <li>Insert game 14</li>
                                <li>Select S7</li>
                                <li>Insert game 15</li>
                                <li>Select V7</li>
                                <li>Insert game 16</li>
                                <li>Select Y7</li>
                                <li>Insert game 17</li>
                                <li>Select AB7</li>
                                <li>Insert champion (game 18)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                At this point, the bracket is done. Now let's go back and fix the team
                                names. Go to the TeamsAndFields sheet. Fill out the team names for the
                                bracket (fill in cells B23 to B31with team names).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now back on the Games sheet, you can click on each "Field #1" or "6:00
                                PM" and put the correct field and time. (You could also do this on the
                                TeamsAndFields sheet).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Lastly, let's fill in some tournament information. Go to the
                                "TournamentInfo" sheet:
                            </p>
                            <zoomable>
                                <floatRight style="width: 15vw;padding-top: 2rem"><img class="whiteBack" src="Images/FinishingTouches.png" /></floatRight>
                            </zoomable>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Select B1, enter "9 Team Tournament"</li>
                                <li>Select B2, enter "Sample Walkthrough"</li>
                                <li>Select B3, enter "Al Houghton Stadium"</li>
                                <li>Select B4, enter "Little League Dr, San Bernardino, CA</li>
                                <li>Select B5, enter "Little League"</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                And the final step is to apply the finishing touches to the bracket:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Click on the <cmdRef>Finishing Touches</cmdRef>
                                    </li>
                                    (
                                    <floatNone style="width: 22px;">
                                        <img src="Images/FinishingTouchesIcon.png" class="whiteBack" style="max-width: 122px">
                                    </floatNone>) button.
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                            And there you go... A completed bracket, formatted and ready for printing.

                                This detailed start will build the same bracket that we built in the QuickStart, but we will
                                go a little further in depth as we build it

                                The first thing you have to do is build the bracket workbook. <prodRef>BracketBuilder</prodRef> comes with lots of
                                built-in double elimination brackets for various team sizes. You can choose the size of the bracket using the
                                bracket chooser. You can also create custom brackets, which is covered <a href="./CustomBrackets.html">in CustomBrackets</a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Once you click "Build a bracket", your workbook will be setup to start building out your bracket.

                                        Most of our time will be spent on the <eltRef>Games Sheet</eltRef>. This sheet has the tournament information as well
                                        as the bracket itself. This is also where you will be building the actual bracket.

                                                This grid is carefully constructed to allow lines to connect games and
                                                create visual affects. You can change things like row height and column
                                                widths, but don't change the pattern.
                                            </p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>
                                                    Rows are in pairs: a full height row for text, and a 1 pixel row for
                                                    lines. You can see this when you look at the row numbers on the left
                                                    side -- they seem to count by twos in the grid (10, 12, 14, 16). The odd
                                                    number rows aren't missing, they are just really short. Those short rows
                                                    give us the lines.

                                                    column for game score, and a 1 pixel column for lines. Notice that the
                                                    column with "Team 1" in it is wider than the score column next to it.
                                                    The line column is even smaller.

                                                        All games have a top and bottom team name. If these are first round
                                                        games, then the seeded team name will be entered. By default these will
                                                        say "Team 1", etc. You can either type in the correct team name, or you
                                                        can go to the "TeamsAndFields" sheet and fill in the team names there.
                                                        Either way, the team names will automatically update throughout the

                                                        The Game Info Block has the field number, game time, and any special text

                                                        either type the correct information directly into the block, or you can go
                                                        to the "TeamsAndFields" sheet and fill in the game information there (just
                                                        look up the game number). Either way, the actual game information on the
                                                        "TeamsAndFields" sheet will automatically update to match what the grid says.

                                        Once you have chosen the size of your bracket, you will see a list of
                                        games that need to be placed in your bracket. The games that are shaded
                                        gray are already in your bracket, but you can still remove them by
                                        clicking the "-" button. The games that are not shaded still need to be
                                        placed in your grid.

                                        In many cases, the add-in can automagically place the game for you. For
                                        first-round games, it will choose the next available spot on the day you
                                        choose. As you get further in the bracket it will place games where they
                                        have to go in order for the lines to work. In some cases, where the grid
                                        has to be reorganized, it will even fixup the grid to make things work.

                                        To insert a game <i>automagically</i>, just select a cell in the day
                                        where you want the game. Its usually best to select a cell close to the
                                        top of the column so its clear you aren't trying to manually place the
                                        game. Then just click the "+" next to the game you want to insert.

                                        Well, its not perfect. If you catch the mistake early (before you insert
