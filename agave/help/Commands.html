    So far we have only looked at some of the features in BracketBuilder. This page will go into
    a lot more detail on each of the commands that are provided
</p>
<p> Let's start with an overview of that parts of the addin'</p>
<section id="Controls">
    <heading>Main Interface</heading>
    <content>
        <p>
            There are several main parts of BracketBuilder that you will be working with:
            <ul>
                <li>Main tools - this is where tools for the whole bracket will be </li>
                <li>Bracket tools - this is where tools for working with games in the bracket are</li>
                <li>Games list - games already on the bracket are shaded gray, others are white</li>
                <li>Message area - informational messages and errors will show up here</li>
                <li>Version number - helpful for making sure you have the latest version</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </content>
</section>
<section id="Controls">
<heading>Main Tools</heading>
<content>
<p>
    The <em>Main Tools</em> are on the toolbar at the top of BracketBuilder (just underneath
    the Trains logo.
</p>
<p> These tools interact with the entire bracket or with the add-in.</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<section id="Undo">
    <heading>Undo/Redo</heading>
    <content>
        <floatRight style="width: 20vw; margin-top: -3rem">
            <img class="whiteBack" src="Images/UndoRedo.png"/>
        </floatRight>

        <p>
            BracketBuilder can't integrate directly with Excel's undo functionality, so we implement our own. For most operations,
            like inserting or removing a game, you can click the <em>Undo</em> to go back. You should be able to go back all the
            way to the beginning of the bracket, unless you have closed and reopened the workbook.
        </p>
        <p>When you undo something, you can also click <em>Redo</em> if you decide you want it back.</p>
        <p>
            Undo is very useful when you are building a bracket and you find yourself working into a corner -- that is,
            if you have placed the games and you find yourself unable to continue because you should have done things
            in a different order (like placing a difficult game first, even though its not the next game on the list
            of games to add).
        </p>
        <br clear="all"/>

</section>
<section id="Update">
    <heading navText="Update Bracket">Update Bracket with Changes</heading>
    <content>
        <floatRight style="width: 20vw; margin-top: -3rem">
            <img class="whiteBack" src="Images/UpdateBracket.png"/>
        </floatRight>

        <p>
            You can change team names, fields, and times directly on the bracket by just typing into the cell (right on top
            of the formula). (NOTE: For team names, only do this for the first game the team plays). When you do this,
            BracketBuilder notices that there is a difference between the text in the bracket and the data on the
            "TeamsAndFields" Sheet. When this happens, the game is considered "dirty".
        </p>
        <p>
            It can be very useful (though not required) for the TeamsAndFields sheet to be kept
            up-to-date with what is on the bracket. To update the TeamsAndFields sheet, click on the <em>Update Bracket</em>
            button. All the games at this point will no longer be dirty.
        </p>
        <br clear="all"/>

<section id="Priorities">
    <heading>Shade Priorities</heading>
    <content>
        <floatRight style="width: 20vw; margin-top: -3rem">
            <img class="whiteBack" src="Images/ShadePriorities.png"/>
        </floatRight>

        <p>
            Its unfortunate that BracketBuilder includes this feature, but it is sadly a reality for many leagues.
            For whatever reason, a game may be considered higher or lower priority based on the teams participating. The
            original reason behind this was about teams that provided volunteer support for the tournament and teams
            that did not. Teams that provide volunteer support are a higher priority when assigning scarce volunteer
            resources for the game. A game with two volunteer teams is the highest priority, next is games with one of
            each, and lastly is games with two teams providing no volunteer support.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you click on the <em>Shade Priorities</em> button, BracketBuilder will shade each game green/yellow/red
            according to the teams involved with the game, according to the priorities assigned to each team. Games that can't
            be determined yet (because the teams aren't known) will not get shaded <b>unless</b> its irrelevant which team
            wins the previous game. For example, if the top team for a game comes from the winner of Game 2, and Game 2 has
            two volunteer teams, then it doesn't matter who wins -- the top team is guaranteed to be a volunteer team.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the TeamsAndFields sheet, each team has a priority (0 is highest, 1 is lowest). By default, all teams are
            highest priority (0). You can change these priorities to change the way games are shaded
        </p>
        <p>I really hope most people don't have to use this feature...</p>

<section id="ShowHide">

        </floatRight>

        <p>
            There are several sheets <em>behind the scenes</em> that BracketBuilder uses. If you are planning on using
            Excel to create a PDF for your bracket (using File/Export and choose PDF), then you probably don't want all
            these sheets to be visible.

<section id="LockDays">

        <floatRight style="width: 20vw; margin-top: -3rem">
            <img class="whiteBack" src="Images/LockDays.png"/>
        </floatRight>

        <p>
            When you make really big brackets, you quickly run out of screen real estate to see the whole bracket. You can
            zoom out, but Excel has annoying repaint bugs when the zoom level is very low (feel free to report them! maybe if
            enough of us complain they might do something about it!)
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to be able to see what days you are working with as you build the bracket, you can use Excel's <em>Freeze Panes</em>
            functionality. That can be tedious to setup (and clear) repeatedly, so you can use the <em>Lock Days</em> command
            to automatically set it up. You can do it again to unlock the days.

            <img class="whiteBack" src="Images/RainoutDay.png"/>
        </floatRight>

        <p>
            I live in the Seattle area, so even well into June we have rainouts. This can be a pain in the bracket since
            there's a lot of manual moving around you have to do, and the merged cells for days of the week is tedious.
        </p>
        <p>
            To make this easier, use the <em>Rainout Day</em> command. This will insert a day into your bracket and
            move all of the games on the day you are raining out to the following day. It will also extend the connections
            across the day.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's up to you to figure out how you want to markup the rainout day -- but at least the bracket made room for you!

        </floatRight>

        <p>
            When you play the championship game, what happens if the team from the winner's bracket wins the game? Well,
            you don't need the what-if game. How do you fix the bracket? You could do a lot of manual formatting, or you
            could just convert the bracket to a modified double elimination bracket and remove the what-if game.
        </p>
        <p>
            To do this, <b>first</b> remove the championship and what-if games from your bracket using the <em>Remove Game</em>
            command. Then, click the <em>RemoveWhatIf</em> command to change the bracket to a modified double-elimination bracket. The
            list of games should update immediately to no longer show the what-if. Now you can just place the championship game
            where you want it and you should have the champion filled in automatically.

        <p>
            As you get started with BracketBuilder, you will notice coaching hints showing up. If you point your mouse at
            these coaching marks, you will see a teaching callout show up with some (hopefully) helpful information. These
            teaching callouts try not to show up too often, and many of them stop showing up after you see them a few times.
            You can also choose to <em>never show again</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            You might find that you want to get them back, though. If that happens, you can click on
            <em>
                Reset Coaching
                Tips
            </em> and they will start showing up again.

        </floatRight>

        <p>
            When you are done placing all your games in the bracket, you will notice that the bracket still doesn't look
            completely polished -- the titles aren't centered, you have extra days in the bracket, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
            At this point, if you click on <em>finishing touches</em>, BracketBuilder will do some cleaning up to make
            your bracket look polished:
            <ul>
                <li>The final day of the bracket is stretched out to cover both the final game as well as the <em>champion</em></li>
                <li>All other days are removed from the bracket after the final game</li>
                <li>The title lines are merged and centered over the bracket</li>
                <li>The <em>Hosted By</em> and <em>Last Updated</em> markers are put at the bottom of the bracket</li>
                <li>
                    The <em>Print Area</em> for the sheet is defined to cover only the bracket (and not the information to the
                    left of the bracket)
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you apply the finishing touches to the bracket, you can print and only the bracket will get printed, or you
            can export to PDF and only the bracket will get exported (assuming you use <em>Show/Hide</em> to hide the extra
            sheets.

                    If you want to move a game on the bracket, you can remove the game (and all of the games after it), and then
                    add the games back where you want them. BracktBuilder can also try to move the game for you, and fix up all
                    the connections. Its not perfect, and if your bracket is large it probably won't work. BUT, if all you want to
                    do is change the size of a game or make a simple move, then give this a try!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first part of moving a game with BracketBuilder is to <em>pick up</em> the game. Just select any cell
                    in or on the game on the bracket, and click the <em>Pick Up Game</em> button. When you do this, the entire
                    game will get selected.

                    After you have picked up the game, you should select where you want the game to go. If you just select
                    a single cell, this will get treated as the <em>Top Team</em> cell for the game. Otherwise, you can
                    select the entire range you want the game to go to. You should only select one column (don't include
                    the score or line columns). Once you have made your selection, click the <em>Drop Game</em> button.

                    If you want to remove a game from the bracket, you can find the game in the list of games and
                    press the - sign to remove it. The other way to do it is to just select any cell in or on the game
                    in the bracket and click the <em>remove game</em> button.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes pieces of games get left behind, especially when the bracket is manually edited. If you want to
                    remove parts of a game that have been left behind, or to remove a broken game complete, select all of the
                    cells you want to clear and click the <em>remove game</em> button.

                    add the game back to the bracket, inserting all of the formulas and formatting to make things work again.
