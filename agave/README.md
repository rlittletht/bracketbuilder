# npm run start
This will start up the dev environment and build (and will continue to live-build)

# npm run publish
This will publish the Add-In. Yes, all the locations are in the sources, but you have to login to azure in the current command session in order for this to work (az login). Make sure you have the Azure command line extensions installed. See https://aka.ms/cli_ref.
